## Configura Minimal Configuration Library

It is a very simple option for configuring a python application:

- Yaml based file configs
- Application can define required and default values
- Configura will validate provided values
- Configura Will ignore unexpected configuration values
- After initialization the config becomes read only
- System can be easily extended for formats other then yaml and sources other than a file
